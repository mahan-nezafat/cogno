let msg = `Alright, let's tackle this problem. So, the user is facing an issue where their Telegram bot is sending messages that are too long, which 
is causing errors. I need to figure out how to help them implement a solution.

First, I remember that Telegram has a message length limit. I think it's around 4096 characters for messages. If a message exceeds that, it throws an error. So, the main goal is to split the message into smaller chunks that fit within this limit.

I should consider different programming languages because the user might be using Python, JavaScript, or another language. Let's focus on 
Python first since it's commonly used for bot development.

In Python, the approach would be to take the long message and split it into parts. Each part should be under the 4096 character limit. I need to think about how to split the message without breaking words or sentences in the middle, but maybe that's optional depending on the 
use case.

So, the steps would be:
1. Check if the message length exceeds the limit.
2. If it does, split the message into chunks.
3. Send each chunk as a separate message.

How to implement the splitting? Maybe using a loop that takes substrings of the message up to the limit. But also, to make it more user-friendly, perhaps split on newlines or spaces to avoid breaking words.

Wait, but the user might not want to split on newlines; maybe they just need any split. So, the simplest way is to take the message, check its length, and if it's over, split it into parts each of 4096 characters.

But wait, 4096 is the maximum, so each chunk should be at most 4096. So, for a message longer than that, we can split it into multiple 4096-character chunks.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants to split the message into sentences or paragraphs, but that's more complex. For now, let's stick with 
the simple character-based split.

So, in Python, the code would involve something like:

max_length = 4096
message = "..."  # the long message

if len(message) > max_length:
    # split into chunks
    chunks = [message[i:i+max_length] for i in range(0, len(message), max_length)]
else:
    chunks = [message]

Then, send each chunk in a loop.

But wait, sometimes when you split messages, especially with Markdown or other formatting, splitting in the middle can cause issues. So, maybe the user should also consider handling code blocks or other formatted text.

Alternatively, another approach is to send the message as a file if it's too long. For example, save the message into a text file and send it as a document. That way, the user can download and read it without the message length issue.

So, the user has two options:
1. Split the message into multiple smaller messages.
2. Send the message as a file.

I should present both options and let the user choose based on their needs.

Now, considering other programming languages. If the user is using JavaScript, the approach is similar. Check the message length, split into chunks, and send each chunk.

For sending files, in JavaScript (using Node.js), you can write the message to a file and then use the Telegram API to send the file.     

Another thing to consider is rate limits. Sending multiple messages quickly might hit Telegram's rate limits, so adding a small delay between messages could help.

Also, if the message contains Markdown or HTML formatting, splitting it might break the formatting. So, the user should ensure that each chunk is properly formatted or disable formatting when splitting.

Wait, but if the message is split in the middle of a code block, it might mess up the rendering. So, perhaps in such cases, sending the message as a file is better.

So, summarizing the solution:

1. Check if the message exceeds the maximum allowed length.
2. If it does, decide whether to split it into multiple messages or send it as a file.
3. For splitting, divide the message into chunks of 4095 characters (to be safe) and send each.
4. For sending as a file, create a text file with the message and send it using the appropriate Telegram API method.

I should also provide code examples for both approaches in Python and maybe JavaScript, as those are common languages for bots.

Additionally, I can mention libraries that simplify sending files, like python-telegram-bot, which has methods for sending documents.     

Wait, in the Python example, using the python-telegram-bot library, the code would be something like:

from telegram import Bot
from telegram.error import TelegramError

bot = Bot(token='YOUR_TOKEN')

def send_message(chat_id, message):
    max_length = 4`;

export const handleLimit = (msg) => {
    if(!msg || msg === undefined) return
    let chunks = [];
    let currentChunk = "";
    if (msg.length < 4000) return; //send
    let paragraphs = msg.split("\n\n");
    // console.log(paragraphs);
    for (let i = 0; i < paragraphs.length; i++) {
        if (currentChunk.length + paragraphs[i].length + 2 > 4000) {
            if (currentChunk.length > 0) {
                chunks.push(currentChunk);
                currentChunk = "";
            }
            if (paragraphs[i].length > 4000) {
                const sentences = paragraphs[i].split(/(?<=\.|\?|\!) /g);
                for (const sentence of sentences) {
                    if (currentChunk.length + sentence.length > 4000) {
                        if (currentChunk.length > 0) {
                            chunks.push(currentChunk);
                            currentChunk = "";
                        }
                        else {

                            currentChunk = sentence
                        }
                    }else {
                        currentChunk += (currentChunk.length > 0 ? " " : "") + sentence
                    }
                }
                
            }else {
                chunks = paragraphs[i]
            }

        }else {
            currentChunk = (currentChunk.length > 0 ? "\n\n" : "") + paragraphs[i]
        }
        if(currentChunk.length > 0) {
            chunks.push(currentChunk)
        }
    }
    // console.log(chunks);
    return chunks
};

// handleLimit(msg);
